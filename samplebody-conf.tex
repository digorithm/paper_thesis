\section{Introduction}

An extended version of the abstract, plus some background information, introduction to the problem being solved then a discussion about the approach to solve the problem. Brief discussion of evaluation.

\subsection{Motivation}

Here I should try to show what is the problem by giving a motivation. Followed by showing why this problem is both interesting and important and why do naive approaches usually fail. Followed by why it hasn't been solved before

\subsection{Definition of the problem}

Here I try to better define the problem in a formal manner.

\subsection{Proposed approach}

Here I should give the key components of my approach and results, followed by the structure of the paper.

\section{Related Work}

Maybe related work would be better now instead of putting it in the end, since there are a lot of related work and they are very relevant to this work, it would be nice to upfront point out what has been done and what would be different in this work.
