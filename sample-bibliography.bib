	abstract = {The complexity of modern computer systems makes performance modeling an invaluable resource for guiding crucial decisions such as workload management, conﬁguration management, and resource provisioning. With continually evolving systems, it is diﬃcult to obtain ground truth about system behavior. Moreover, system management policies must adapt to changes in workload and conﬁguration to continue making eﬃcient decisions. Thus, we require data-driven modeling techniques that auto-extract relationships between a system’s input workload, its conﬁguration parameters, and consequent performance. This dissertation argues that statistical machine learning (SML) techniques are a powerful asset to system performance modeling. We present an SML-based methodology that extracts correlations between a workload’s pre-execution characteristics or conﬁguration parameters, and post-execution performance observations. We leverage these correlations for performance prediction and optimization. We present three success stories that validate the usefulness of our methodology on storage and compute based parallel systems. In all three scenarios, we outperform state of the art alternatives. Our results strongly suggest the use of SML-based performance modeling to improve the quality of system management decisions.},

	abstract = {Contemporary software systems are becoming increasingly large, heterogeneous, and decentralised. They operate in dynamic environments and their architectures exhibit complex trade-offs across dimensions of goals, time, and interaction, which emerges internally from the systems and externally from their environment. This gives rise to the vision of self-aware architecture, where design decisions and execution strategies for these concerns are dynamically analysed and seamlessly managed at run-time. Drawing on the concept of self-awareness from psychology, this paper extends the foundation of software architecture styles for self-adaptive systems to arrive at a new principled approach for architecting self-aware systems. We demonstrate the added value and applicability of the approach in the context of service provisioning to cloud-reliant service-based applications.},
